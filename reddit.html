  <div class="article_text" id="post">
    <p>What's the difference between a life pro tip, and one that is a bit more questionable? This can be sometimes a subtle difference, or a moral grey area to distinguish, even for humans.  </p>
<p>Life Pro Tip: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A concise and specific tip that improves life for you and those around you in a specific and significant way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>Example</em>: "If you want to learn a new language, figure out the 100 most frequently used words and start with them. Those words make up about 50% of everyday speech, and should be a very solid basis."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Unethical Life Pro Tip is a tip that improves your life in a meaningful way, perhaps at the expense of others and/or with questionable legality. Due to their nature, do not actually follow any of these tips–they're just for fun. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>Example: "Save business cards of people you don't like. If you ever hit a parked car accidentally, just write "sorry" on the back and leave it on the windshield."</p>
<p>Let's collect posts (web scrap) from 2 subreddits, and create a machine learning model using Natural Langauge Processing (NLP) to classify which subreddit a particular post belongs too. Can my model pick up on sarcasm, internet 'trolling', or tongue-in-cheek semantic of sentences? Probably not, but let's try. I hope you have as much fun playing with this, as I did making it. </p>
<p>If you're feeling lucky, visit my app for a <a href="https://nlp-reddit-garry.herokuapp.com">Life Pro Tip</a>!</p>

<h1>Reddit API</h1>
<p>Fortunately, Reddit provides a public JSON end point, so we can easily consume that format, and manipulate it a Pandas DataFrame. Simply add <code>.json</code> at the end of the URL.</p>
<p>If you plan to run your own <code>get</code> requests, keep in mind that Reddit has a limit of 25 posts / request. In conjunction with <code>for</code> loop, write a <code>time.sleep()</code> function in Python (or something equivalent) to avoid a 429 Too Many Requests error. </p>
<h2>Data dictionary</h2>
<p>We are interested in the following features:</p>
<table class="table table-responsive table-bordered">
<thead>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Target variable, y </b></td>
<td> <p> subreddit (str) </p> </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Design matrix, X </b></td>
<td> 
<p>title (str)</p>
<p>score (int)</p>
<p>num_comments (int)</p>
<p>author (int)</p>
<p>name (int)</p>
</ul>
</td></tr>   

</tbody>
</table>

<h1>Pre-processing data</h1>
<p>First, I have to pre-process the data, and use natural language processing packages to tokenize strings to individual words. We will be using Python's Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) package.</p>
<p>Follow along if you want to create your own classifier, otherwise, skip to the results. All code is available on <a href="https://github.com/garrrychan/nlp_reddit">GitHub</a>. Refer to <code>reddit_garry.py</code> for scraping.</p>

<p>This is really performant off the bat with 99.9% training accuracy and 89.5% test accuracy. Yes, there is overfitting but it's picking up signal, in the text.</p>
<p>There's many more false positives than false negatives. One could argue, false positives are not as bad as false negatives since you don't want to heed the advice of a bad tip, but if you miss a life pro tip, it's not as damaging. If we wanted to be more strict, we could tweak the threshold such that only predictions &gt; 75% would be classified as UnethicalLifeProTip.</p>
<p>"Give the same perfume to your wife and your girlfriend. It could save your ass one day." 🙅🏻‍♂️ - <em>Not a Life Pro Tip</em> but was predicted a <em>Pro Tip</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The more 'popular' i.e. more comments and score, the great likelihood that it is unethical. Controversial posts tend to gain more popularity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this training set, if your document includes the word 'business', then the likelihood of being unethical is far more likely by 3x. There's probably a lot of unethical comments around taking advantage of businesses!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)</h2>
<p>Compared to CountVectorizer, TF-IDF vectorizer tells us which words are most discriminating between documents.
Words that occur often in one document but don't occur in many documents are important and contain a great deal of discriminating power. Note, TF-IDF figures are between [0,1]. The score is based on how often a word is compared in your document (spam) and other documents.</p>

<p>Test accuracy decreases to 85.4% which is lower than CountVectorizer. There are probably not as many discriminating words. Common words are helpful in distinguishing between the two classes. Words of high frequency that are predictive of one of the classes.</p>
<p>It's not entire clear which words are the most influential, some words might indicate sarcasm. Overall, it's impressive that a logistic regression model is so powerful already, let's try a few more algorithms.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Naive Bayes Classifier</h2>
<p>The multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is appropriate for classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts for text classification), as the columns of X are all integer counts.</p>
<p>Note, this classifier accepts only positive values so I have run the abs function on my scaled features. While I have the option to add a prior, I have opted to have Sklearn estimate from training data directly. I don't have a strong opinion if a particular post is in one subreddit over the other. </p>

<p>Out of the box, SVC is not performant. I have to tune hyperparameters to improve the accuracy. Recall, if C is large, we do not regularize much (larger budget that the margin can be violated), leading to a more perfect classifier of our training data. Of course, there will be a trade off in overfitting and greater error due to higher variance. A smaller gamma helps with lower bias, by trading off with higher variance. Gamma = "scale", which uses <code>n_features</code> * <code>X.var()</code> tends to work well. </p>

<p>Given these results, my selected production model will be the logistic regression model with CountVectorizer as the vectorizer. The Logistic Model is the nearly the most performant, but also provides a high level of interpret-ability compared to SVM.</p>
<p>In conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The more 'popular' i.e. more comments and score, the great likelihood that it is unethical. Controversial posts tend to gain more popularity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this training set, if your document includes the word 'business', then the likelihood of being unethical is far more likely by 3x. There's probably a lot of unethical comments around taking advantage of businesses!</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Wrap up</h1>
<p>I was able to create an app using Natural Language Processing to classify which subreddit a particular post belongs to.</p>
<p>While this was a fun use case of NLP, this analysis is widely applicable other areas, such as politics in classifying fake news vs. real news, or for eCommerce, with sentiment analysis of user reviews (i.e. polarity classification - positive, negative of neutral). Further, many virtual assistants (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant) use NLP to understand human questions and provide the appropriate responses.</p>
<p>In these scenarios, there would be far greater consequences, if the prediction was a false-positive or false-negative, so fine tuning the model to adjust for these thresholds is critical.</p>
<p>As a next step, I hope to investigate other NLP open source packages such as <a href="https://spacy.io/">Spacy</a>!</p>
