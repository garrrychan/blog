I had to apply what I've learned so far, by combining concepts from data science and software development. Additionally, it was an exercise to work in pairs, tackle unstructured problems, and think outside the box."

    "**Our bot must:**\n",
    "* Be built on top of a machine learning algorithm\n",
    "* Be able to prove that it's not \"peeking\" at user input (target leakage)\n",
    "* Have a flask front-end that can accept user input \n",
    "* Keep track of wins and losses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stretch goals:**\n",
    "* An ability to switch between different \"engines\" (naive, random, hard-coded, algorithmic)\n",
    "* An ability for your bot to learn from my specific play-style and update turn-over-turn\n",
    "* Flask that's prettier than just a couple of white input boxes\n",
    "* Your bot to a hosted website on the internet, somehow, somewhere "

    "* **Enjoying software development** - Typically, my data science work is in individual scripts on Jupyter Notebook or Atom, a text editor. By using Flask, [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), a Python micro web framework, I was able to spin up a lightweight website. It was a boost of confidence to successfully write simple APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Creating a click-able prototype** - Learning how to create a click-able prototype is rewarding, as it prepares me for future larger projects. This app has a UI component, and provides better interactivity than a static notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Learning front end basics in HTML and CSS** - As Data Scientists, we should learn just enough HTML and CSS to be dangerous with simple apps showcase our models. It's important to be able to speak their language as they are able to improve the overall app. This hackathon pushed me to read and write more HTML and CSS and I'm glad I discovered OSS libraries such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Collaborating in teams** - This was my first time developing with a teammate, and we used GitHub for version control. Fortunately, there was a rough division of labour as I focused on the front end, and Flask component and she focused on the modeling. A good skill to have is to be able to perform code reviews and also merge conflicts. \n",

    "#### üòê What was confusing?\n",
    "* **Preparing the data into form ready for machine learning algorithms** - This data was not ready in its raw form, and the observations had to be grouped into what was thrown in a game, and the player's following throw. Using dictionaries, and Pandas data frame helped tackle this problem. For example, if I created a feature that required the player's previous n throws, then I would need n user throws before I would be able to make one new prediction!\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Crystalizing my understanding in Markov Chains** Markov chains are used in Bayesian statistics and implementing PyMC3. In the case of rock paper scissors, a hint was to use Markov Chain's stochastic process.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Markov property refers to the memoryless property of a stochastic process. By definition, if the conditional probability distribution of future states of the process  depends only upon the _present state_, not on the sequence of events that preceded it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Said another way, a smart bot should be able to pick up if a player is only playing rock, after a particular scenario, and subsequently throw paper. The bot is predicting that player transitions from one state to another state with a probabilistic process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Wrestling with localhost, prototyping in Atom and Terminal** - Practice, practice, practice. While this is new to me, I'm appreciate prototyping in Atom and terminal more than in Jupyter notebooks. By using Hydrogen, a package on Atom, I'm able to run code interactively and 'peak' into objects in-line in real time. \n",

    "- Create a ```requirements.txt```, and inside the file specify your app's dependencies\n",
    "```$ pip freeze > requirements.txt ``` Note, this lists all your dependencies, so you should scrub it for only the modules your app needs.\n",
    "- Add ```gunicorn```, the web server recommended by Heroku for Python apps\n",
    "- Create a text file named ```Procfile```, and inside the file declare the command to execute and start your web app.\n",
