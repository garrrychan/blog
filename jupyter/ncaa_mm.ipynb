    "Each year, close to $4 billion is wagered on the NCAA Division 1 men's basketball tournament. Most of that money is wagered where the objective is to correctly predict winners of each game, with emphasis on the last four teams remaining (the Final Four). \n",

    "In this project, my motivation is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on a college's regular season performance and seeding information, can I predict whether or not they will reach the final four? \n",
    "\n",
    "What are the variables that are correlated to predicting teams that make it to the final four? As a corollary, my model will also output the associated probabilities of making it to the final 4. Am I able to outperform a naive model? As even the sport pundits will tell you, since 2008, 53% of the time, at least 2 No. 1 seeds make the final four. So just by choosing two No 1. seeds, you're half way there.\n",

Although it's strange to see that it has a negative sign, this is probably the case because schools that make to to the final four actually have lower win % than schools who do not make it to the final four because they face tougher competition (57% avg vs 72% avg). This supports the argument that which conference you play for is very important in predictive power. \n",

As your seed increases by 1, your likelihood of reaching final four is 0.47x less. This makes sense... a 3 seed only has a ~10% (0.47^3) of making to final four! This is consistent with FiveThirtyEight's forecasts. Purdue, Houston, & Texas Tech had 10-14% of making it to the Final four.\n",

    "\n",
    "Overall, I was able to improve from the baseline logistic model, by 1.5% in train accuracy, 0% in test accuracy, and 2.6% in ROC curve. What I am impressed about is that the best model via Lasso is able to predict with less variables, while also maintaining interpretability (no wild transformations). \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Win_% is the most important predictor. Although it's strange to see that it has a negative sign, this is probably the case because schools that make to to the final four actually have lower win % than schools who do not make it to the final four because they face tougher competition (57% avg vs 72% avg). This supports the argument that which conference you play for is very important in predictive power. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Again, your strongest conferences, are the big_twelve, acc, big_ten. If you play in acc, your likelihood of reaching final four is very low, because you will likely be dominated by the top tier schools in those conferences. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In terms of regular season states, 3PM for and against is important, as the game continues to move shooting more threes, as it's been proven to be an effective strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Lastly, seed is not to be overlooked as it's a good composite score for a team's strength, capturing a lot of regular season performance. As your seed increases by 1, your likelihood of reaching final four is 0.47x less. This makes sense... a 3 seed only has a ~10% (0.47^3) of making to final four! This is consistent with FiveThirtyEight's forecasts. Purdue, Houston, & Texas Tech had 10-14% of making it to the Final four.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similar to the NBA, margin of victory is a predictive variable though with a positive correlation. In the NBA, there is more parity since each team plays one another at least twice in a season, so individual team stats are more important than seed & conference.\n",
    "\n",
    "My model predicts the probability of a team reaching the final four, primarily based on its regular season data, seed, and conference. I would recommend coaches to develop the three ball ability, as it continues dominate in the NBA and at the college level, and to outperform in the regular season to improve your seeding, to ultimately improve your chances in moving to the final four, through playing weaker opponents.

    "\n",
    "* In this example, there isn't a penalty on false positives vs false negatives, as wrong is wrong. Predicting a loser who won isn't worse than a winner that lost. There may be implications in gambling, but that's out of scope. \n",
