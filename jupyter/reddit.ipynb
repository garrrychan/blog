        "While this was a fun use case of NLP, this analysis is widely applicable other areas, such as politics in classifying fake news vs. real news, or for eCommerce, with sentiment analysis of user reviews (i.e. polarity classification - positive, negative of neutral). Further, many virtual assistants (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant) use NLP to understand human questions and provide the appropriate responses.\n",
