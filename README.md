# Blog
This repo holds the source code for my blog, written primarily in Python hosted on Github pages.
Blog posts are written in Jupyter Notebooks, converted to Markdown, and then quickly published directly using Pelican, a static site generator. 
It is powered by Jinja2, a templating engine for Python.
